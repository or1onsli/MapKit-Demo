## What's this project about
This is a simple exercise with MapKit and CoreData in **Swift 3**/**Xcode 8.3.3**. I made it after a demo request for a job interview with The Floow Limited in 2017. 

This sample app records and stores journeys making them available for consultation at a latter time. It uses **CoreData** for the storage of the journeys' informations, **MapKit** for the journeys' tracking and **UIKit** for the the UI of the app.
